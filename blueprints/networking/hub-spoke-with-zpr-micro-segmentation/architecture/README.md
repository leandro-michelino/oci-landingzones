# Hub-Spoke ZPR Micro-Segmentation Architecture

Author: Leandro Michelino | ACE | leandro.michelino@oracle.com

This page is the deployment architecture for `blueprints/networking/hub-spoke-with-zpr-micro-segmentation`. It is intentionally ASCII-first so it
is easy to review in GitHub, terminals, pull requests, runbooks, and customer notes without a
diagramming tool.

## Deployment Purpose

Adds Zero Trust Packet Routing configuration and policies to a hub-spoke network for micro-segmented traffic control.

| North-south: external or service traffic enters the hub, then routes through DRG attachments to spokes.  |
| East-west: spoke-to-spoke traffic centralizes through the DRG and any hub inspection controls.           |
| Hand-off: hub/spoke VCN IDs, DRG IDs, attachment IDs, subnet maps, route targets, and service edge IDs.  |

## Terraform Components

| Kind | Name | Source Or Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Module | `network` | `blueprints/networking/hub-spoke-with-drg-and-three-tier-vcns @ v0.2.0` |
| Module | `zpr` | `modules/networking/zpr @ v0.2.0` |

## Request And Deployment Flow

- Operator reviews CIDRs, subnet maps, gateway flags, route targets, and inspection requirements.
- Terraform creates the network foundation first, then dependent attachments or network services declared in main.tf.
- Traffic follows the diagrammed route path, and outputs expose VCN, subnet, DRG, gateway, DNS, inspection, or policy IDs for the next deployment.

## Traffic And Trust Boundaries

- Control plane traffic is local operator or CI authentication into the OCI provider and the Ansible Terraform runner.
- Data plane traffic is the packet or service path shown in the ASCII diagram; if this deployment only creates identity or governance resources, the data plane is intentionally permission and signal flow instead of network packets.
- Trust boundaries are the tenancy, compartment, VCN, subnet, DRG, private endpoint, identity domain, or managed service edges shown in the diagram.
- Secrets, OCIDs, customer CIDRs, endpoint URLs, and contact data belong in ignored local tfvars or a secure pipeline variable store, not in committed files.

## Detailed Architecture Notes

These notes expand the diagram with the design details that usually matter during review, plan, and hand-off.

- The hub-spoke network creates the normal packet path, then ZPR configuration and policies define additional communication authorization.
- ZPR policies should describe allowed flows between hub services, spoke web/app/db tiers, and OCI services.
- Route tables and DRG attachments still move packets; ZPR decides whether the packet is allowed by policy.
- Review policy scope and default-deny effects carefully before applying to shared or production compartments.

## Operational Boundaries

- Keep customer-specific OCIDs, CIDRs, DNS names, endpoints, contacts, and secrets in ignored local tfvars or approved pipeline variables.
- Run plan from this blueprint folder so relative module paths, provider files, and local Ansible runners resolve predictably.
- Treat apply and destroy as approval-gated operations; use the guarded Ansible playbooks or a reviewed Terraform workflow.
- Re-check route exposure, IAM scope, compartment boundaries, tags, and output hand-offs whenever inputs change.

## Review Checklist

- Confirm the diagram matches `main.tf`: `network`, `zpr`.
- Confirm the described traffic path is the path you want in OCI before apply.
- Confirm public exposure, private endpoint access, DNS behavior, DRG routing, and inspection points are intentional where present.
- Confirm IAM scopes, compartment boundaries, tags, and operational outputs match the deployment README.
- Confirm `ansible/plan.yml`, `ansible/apply.yml`, and `ansible/destroy.yml` still point at the shared Terraform runner.
