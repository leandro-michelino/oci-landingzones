# Hub-Spoke With Dual Region DR

Author: Leandro Michelino | ACE | leandro.michelino@oracle.com

This deployment README belongs only to `blueprints/networking/hub-spoke-with-dual-region-dr`. It is the run-facing guide for this blueprint; the detailed ASCII design lives beside it in `architecture/README.md`.

## Deployment Purpose

Creates paired primary and secondary hub-spoke networking for disaster-recovery-ready regional separation.

## When To Use This Deployment

- Network foundations are needed in two regions.
- Primary and secondary traffic paths need matching structure.
- DR planning requires region-specific outputs.

## What This Deploys

The Terraform in this folder wires the following local components:

- Terraform module `primary_network`
- Terraform module `secondary_network`

The exact OCI behavior is controlled by `variables.tf` and the values supplied in your local ignored `terraform.tfvars` file.

```

## Inputs To Decide

Base tenancy and naming inputs:
- `tenancy_ocid`
- `current_user_ocid`
- `region`
- `home_region`
- `oci_config_profile`
- `org`
- `environment`
- `region_key`
- `defined_tags`
- `freeform_tags`

Deployment-specific inputs to review:
- `secondary_region`
- `secondary_region_key`
- `compartment_ocid`
- `secondary_compartment_ocid`

Important enable flags and switches:
- None declared in this folder.

Review `terraform.tfvars.example` first, then create a local ignored `terraform.tfvars` for real OCIDs, CIDRs, names, recipients, and enable flags.

## Outputs And Hand-Off

This deployment exports the following outputs from `outputs.tf`:

- `blueprint_name`
- `name_prefix`
- `resource_ids`
- `primary_hub_vcn_id`
- `secondary_hub_vcn_id`
- `primary_drg_id`
- `secondary_drg_id`
- `primary_spoke_vcn_ids`
- `secondary_spoke_vcn_ids`

Use these outputs as the contract for downstream blueprints, runbooks, customer notes, or manual hand-off. If an output name changes, update dependent documentation and consumers in the same change.

## Terraform And Ansible Workflow

Use direct Terraform when you are iterating locally:

```bash
cd blueprints/networking/hub-spoke-with-dual-region-dr
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
```

Use the local Ansible wrapper when you want the same runner shape used across the repo:

```bash
cd blueprints/networking/hub-spoke-with-dual-region-dr
ansible-playbook -i localhost, ansible/plan.yml
CONFIRM_APPLY=true ansible-playbook -i localhost, ansible/apply.yml
CONFIRM_DESTROY=true ansible-playbook -i localhost, ansible/destroy.yml
```

`apply.yml` and `destroy.yml` are intentionally guarded. Keep that behavior for customer-facing or shared environments.

## Deployment Order

1. Deploy or identify the target compartment.
2. Review CIDRs, subnets, gateways, route tables, DNS, and inspection choices.
3. Populate `terraform.tfvars` with customer-specific network values.
4. Run plan and review traffic path changes.
5. Apply, then hand VCN, subnet, DRG, DNS, or inspection outputs to workloads and extensions.

## Architecture

The full detailed ASCII architecture is local to this deployment:

```text
architecture/README.md
```

That file documents the ownership boundary, Terraform components, request flow, state and output contract, operational boundaries, review checklist, and the expected Terraform + Ansible output at the end of the deployment.

## Review Before Apply

- Confirm provider aliases and region variables.
- Review CIDR ranges across both regions.
- Keep primary and secondary route assumptions explicit.
- Confirm the local `architecture/README.md` still matches `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf`.
- Confirm no generated Terraform files, state files, plans, or local tfvars are committed.

## Validation

From the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/validate-all.sh
```

The validator checks Terraform formatting, required deployment README files, required architecture README sections, `terraform init -backend=false`, `terraform validate`, root Ansible syntax, blueprint-local Ansible syntax, optional scanners when installed, and cleanup of generated Terraform artifacts.
