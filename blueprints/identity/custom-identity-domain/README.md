# Custom Identity Domain

Author: Leandro Michelino | ACE | leandro.michelino@oracle.com

This deployment README belongs only to `blueprints/identity/custom-identity-domain`. It is the run-facing guide for this blueprint; the detailed ASCII design lives beside it in `architecture/README.md`.

## Deployment Purpose

Creates one or more custom OCI identity domains and optional regional replicas for a named identity boundary.

## When To Use This Deployment

- A customer needs custom identity-domain naming or structure.
- Multiple identity domains need consistent creation.
- Replica regions must be explicit.

## What This Deploys

The Terraform in this folder wires the following local components:

- Terraform resource `oci_identity_domain.this`
- Terraform resource `oci_identity_domain_replication_to_region.replicas`

The exact OCI behavior is controlled by `variables.tf` and the values supplied in your local ignored `terraform.tfvars` file.

    `-- destroy.yml            Guarded destroy
```

## Inputs To Decide

Base tenancy and naming inputs:
- `tenancy_ocid`
- `current_user_ocid`
- `region`
- `home_region`
- `org`
- `environment`
- `region_key`
- `defined_tags`
- `freeform_tags`

Deployment-specific inputs to review:
- `compartment_ocid`
- `identity_domains`

Important enable flags and switches:
- None declared in this folder.

Review `terraform.tfvars.example` first, then create a local ignored `terraform.tfvars` for real OCIDs, CIDRs, names, recipients, and enable flags.

## Outputs And Hand-Off

This deployment exports the following outputs from `outputs.tf`:

- `blueprint_name`
- `name_prefix`
- `resource_ids`
- `identity_domain_ids`
- `identity_domain_urls`
- `replica_region_ids`

Use these outputs as the contract for downstream blueprints, runbooks, customer notes, or manual hand-off. If an output name changes, update dependent documentation and consumers in the same change.

## Terraform And Ansible Workflow

Use direct Terraform when you are iterating locally:

```bash
cd blueprints/identity/custom-identity-domain
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
```

Use the local Ansible wrapper when you want the same runner shape used across the repo:

```bash
cd blueprints/identity/custom-identity-domain
ansible-playbook -i localhost, ansible/plan.yml
CONFIRM_APPLY=true ansible-playbook -i localhost, ansible/apply.yml
CONFIRM_DESTROY=true ansible-playbook -i localhost, ansible/destroy.yml
```

`apply.yml` and `destroy.yml` are intentionally guarded. Keep that behavior for customer-facing or shared environments.

## Deployment Order

1. Confirm the target tenancy and identity-domain strategy.
2. Review group, dynamic-group, domain, replica, and policy inputs.
3. Populate `terraform.tfvars` with identity naming and scope values.
4. Run plan and inspect IAM or domain impact.
5. Apply, then hand group, domain, and policy outputs to administrators.

## Architecture

The full detailed ASCII architecture is local to this deployment:

```text
architecture/README.md
```

That file documents the ownership boundary, Terraform components, request flow, state and output contract, operational boundaries, review checklist, and the expected Terraform + Ansible output at the end of the deployment.

## Review Before Apply

- Confirm domain names and license type.
- Review replica region list.
- Coordinate federation and app integration after the domain exists.
- Confirm the local `architecture/README.md` still matches `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf`.
- Confirm no generated Terraform files, state files, plans, or local tfvars are committed.

## Validation

From the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/validate-all.sh
```

The validator checks Terraform formatting, required deployment README files, required architecture README sections, `terraform init -backend=false`, `terraform validate`, root Ansible syntax, blueprint-local Ansible syntax, optional scanners when installed, and cleanup of generated Terraform artifacts.
